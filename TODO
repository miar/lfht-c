-> I'm currently extending the model to support concurrent deletion of
keys. For the moment I will assume that only chain nodes will be
deleted, i.e. buckets arrays will remain allocated.
    --> Seems to be ok for the moment.

  -> check correctness with PIN and Anaconda (check stuff in misc/)
  -> use swig (wrapper) to access C from Java.
  -> test LFHT in the C-Tries java framework.
