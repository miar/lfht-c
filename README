This is a small project that implements an external version of the
Lock Free Hash Tries (LFHT) model implemented in the YapTab system.
For the moment the LFHT supports only check and insert operations in a
lock-free fashion.

The model does not support the delete operation. The paper "A
Lock-Free Hash Trie Design for Concurrent Tabled Logic Programs",
which should be available soon in the IJPP journal, has the
formalization (lock-freedom and linearizability).
